Thanks! Based on the visual diagrams you shared (which are a continuation of the **Kubernetes Day 34–35** topics), here’s how I would integrate and **format the diagrams with proper grammar without removing any original words** — especially focusing on what each diagram explains about **Deployment, Service (SVC), Load Balancing, and Labels/Selectors** in Kubernetes.

---

### 🧠 Diagram-Based Addendum (Day 34–35 Concepts with Visual Mapping)

---

#### 📌 Diagram 1: Load Balancer, Deployment, SVC, Pod IP Change Problem (Service Needed)

* **Problem Setup**:

  * Deployment creates 3 Pods with IPs:

    * `172.16.3.4`
    * `172.16.3.5`
    * `172.16.3.6`
  * Users (User1, User2, User3) are directly accessing individual Pod IPs for "Payment" application.
  * One Pod is recreated (e.g., now `172.16.3.8`) → **User1 now fails to connect**.

* **Solution**:

  * Introduce a **Service (SVC)**.
  * Users now access via:
    `payment.default.svc` (Kubernetes service name)
  * Service performs **load balancing** and hides IP changes from users.
  * Internally, service routes traffic using QProxy to available Pods.

> ✅ This avoids the problem of stale IPs and user failures, thanks to Kubernetes' **auto-healing** + **SVC abstraction**.

---

#### 📌 Diagram 2: Purpose of `SVC` — 2 Key Features

* **SVC →**

  1. **Load Balancing**
  2. **Service Discovery**

* **How?**

  * Service assigns **Labels & Selectors** to track Pods, not IPs.
  * If IP changes, Label remains.
  * Resilient and dynamic.

* **Bottom Line**:
  IP address changes → **solved** by mapping requests using **Labels & Selectors**, not static IPs.

---

#### 📌 Diagram 3: Full Flow — Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pods → Service (with Discovery)

* **Deployment (YAML)** defines:

  * **Metadata:** `label: app: payment`
* **ReplicaSet** (RS) creates 3 Pods.
* Each Pod is labeled:

  * `label: app: payment`
* A **Service** selects all Pods with `label=payment`
* Even if Pod 1 fails:

  * RS recreates it with **same label**
  * SVC continues forwarding traffic without issues

✅ Demonstrates **Service Discovery** using **labels** instead of static tracking.

---

#### 📌 Diagram 4: Recap of SVC Benefits

**Service (SVC) →**

1. **Load Balancing**
2. **Service Discovery**
3. **Expose to World**

> ✅ These solve production issues:

* Users outside don't use internal Pod IPs.
* Load is balanced.
* IP changes are invisible.

---

#### 📌 Diagram 5: Exposing App to World — Service Types

**Service Type Comparison**:

| Type           | Access Level                   | Use Case Example         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `ClusterIP`    | Only within Kubernetes network | Internal Microservices   |
| `NodePort`     | Access via Node IP + Port      | Org-internal dev/testing |
| `LoadBalancer` | Public access via cloud ELB    | e.g., `amazon.com`       |

* **Node Pool:** runs on VPC nodes.
* **ClusterIP:** stays within Cluster network.
* **LoadBalancer:** makes use of cloud control manager to get external ELB from AWS, Azure, GCP.

### Summary of Diagram-Enhanced Concepts:

| Feature                                           | Explained In Diagram |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Auto-healing via RS                               | ✅ Diagram 3          |
| Load balancing via SVC                            | ✅ Diagram 1, 2       |
| Label-based routing                               | ✅ Diagram 2, 3       |
| Deployment → RS → Pods → SVC flow                 | ✅ Diagram 3          |
| Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) | ✅ Diagram 5          |
| Exposing apps to public/internally                | ✅ Diagram 5          |

### ✅ Final Takeaway

These diagrams reinforce the transcript's theory with visual examples of:

* Why Services are necessary
* How they handle auto-healing pods
* How traffic is balanced and discovered
* How apps are exposed to users (internal/external)

Let me know if you want me to format these into a PDF or include them in a presentation!

**Kubernetes in Production: Transcript – Day 35 (Q\&A with Grammar Corrections, Full Transcript with Original Wording Retained)**

---

**Q: Who is the speaker and what is today’s topic?**
**A:** Hello everyone, my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel. So today we are at Day 35 of our complete DevOps course. In this class, we will try to learn about Kubernetes Services.

---

**Q: Why is Service considered a critical component in Kubernetes?**
**A:** Like I told you earlier, in production scenarios, we don't deploy Pods directly. Instead, we usually deploy a **Deployment**. For each Deployment, you will most often create a **Service**.

---

**Q: Why do we need a Service in Kubernetes? What happens if there is no Service?**
**A:** Let's assume there is no concept of Services in Kubernetes. In that case, when a DevOps engineer deploys a Pod using a Deployment, the Deployment creates a ReplicaSet, and the ReplicaSet creates Pods.

For example, say we require **three replicas**. If there are multiple users trying to access the app concurrently (say 10), and all traffic goes to a single Pod, it will crash. So we scale Pods.

Now, if one of those Pods goes down due to network issues or container failure, the ReplicaSet **auto-heals** it. But here's the problem: **the new Pod comes with a new IP address**. So even though the app is up, any user trying to access the old IP address fails.

You, as a DevOps engineer, might have shared the IP `172.16.3.4`, but the Pod is now at `172.16.3.8`. So user access breaks.

---

**Q: Isn’t this just how Docker behaves? How does Kubernetes solve it?**
**A:** Yes, this is the same limitation of Docker. But Kubernetes introduces **Services** to fix this.

A Service is an abstraction over Pods. Instead of giving users actual Pod IPs (which change), you give them a **Service name** like `payment.default.svc`. The Service **load balances** requests across Pods and **auto-discovers** them using **labels and selectors** — not IPs.

---

**Q: Can you explain this using a real-world analogy?**
**A:** Sure. Let's take Google. Do you connect to `100.64.2.7` or `172.16.3.9`? No. You connect to `google.com`, and load balancing happens behind the scenes.

Similarly, in Kubernetes, you create:

* **Deployment** → creates → **ReplicaSet** → creates → **Pods**
* **Service** → uses labels to identify and load-balance across Pods

---

**Q: How does Service Discovery work in Kubernetes?**
**A:** Instead of tracking Pod IPs (which change), Services use **labels**.

Let’s say all Pods are labeled: `app: payment`. The Service is configured with a selector: `app: payment`.
So even if Pods go down and come up with new IPs, the **label remains constant**.
That’s how Services achieve **auto-discovery**.

---

**Q: Can you summarize the behavior of Services so far?**
**A:** Yes. Services in Kubernetes offer:

1. **Load Balancing**: Routes user traffic across Pods.
2. **Service Discovery**: Uses labels/selectors to find matching Pods.

---

**Q: What else can a Service do?**
**A:** A Service can also **expose the application to the external world**.

There are 3 main types of Services:

* **ClusterIP** (default): Only accessible inside the Kubernetes cluster.
* **NodePort**: Accessible on `NodeIP:Port`, within the network/VPC.
* **LoadBalancer**: Accessible **publicly**. The cloud provider creates a public IP (like AWS ELB).

---

**Q: What is the role of Cloud Control Manager in LoadBalancer Services?**
**A:** When you create a `LoadBalancer` type Service on cloud (like AWS), the Kubernetes **Cloud Control Manager** notifies the cloud API to create a **public Load Balancer IP**.

That public IP is then used to route requests to your app.

---

**Q: What happens on Minikube or local clusters for LoadBalancer services?**
**A:** LoadBalancer services **do not work by default** on Minikube or local clusters because there is no cloud API. There's a workaround using **Ingress** (which we’ll cover later).

---

**Q: Can you summarize Service Types with examples?**
**A:**

| Service Type | Access Scope | Use Case                       |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| ClusterIP    | Internal     | Internal microservice calls    |
| NodePort     | VPC/internal | Org-wide access for testing    |
| LoadBalancer | Public       | Public access e.g., amazon.com |

* Example: If you're working for **amazon.com**, you’ll use **LoadBalancer** type.
* If only internal VPC access is needed, use **NodePort**.
* If it's purely for internal Kubernetes traffic, use **ClusterIP**.

---

**Q: Final summary – What are the 3 major advantages of Kubernetes Service?**
**A:**

1. **Load Balancing**
2. **Service Discovery**
3. **Expose to External World**

---

**Q: Assignment & Tips?**
**A:**

* Draw a diagram for this flow (Deployment → RS → Pod → Service)
* Create services of different types in a test cluster.
* Share your diagram and notes on LinkedIn or GitHub.

**Kubernetes in Production: Transcript – Day 35 (Grammar Corrected, Full Transcript with Original Wording)**

---

Hello everyone, my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel. So today we are at Day 35 of our complete DevOps course. In this class, we will try to learn about Kubernetes Services. So, Service is a very critical component of Kubernetes.

Like I told you, in production scenarios we don't deploy a pod, but we usually deploy a deployment, right? So this is what we learned in the last class. This is our learning from the last class. Similarly, once you deploy a deployment, for each deployment most of the times you will create a service in the world of Kubernetes.

Why will we create this service and what is the importance of service? Let's try to understand in today's class.

Before we learn anything, what we usually do is we'll try to learn the "why" aspect of it, right? Why do we need a service in Kubernetes and what happens if there is no service in Kubernetes?

Let's talk about the scenarios of no service. Now everything that I am going to talk about is assuming that what if there is no concept of services in Kubernetes. So what will happen?

Usually, like our previous classes, what a developer or DevOps engineer would do: he will deploy his pod as a deployment in Kubernetes. What that pod will do—what the deployment would do—it would create a replica set, and what the replica set would do, it would create a pod.

If the pod count is one, it would create a single pod. Or if the replicas are multiple, then it would create multiple replicas. Let's say we have the requirement of creating three replicas. So assume this is replica one, replica two, and replica three.

Why do we need multiple replicas of a pod? For a general understanding, let's say there is one user—then in such cases you don't need it. But let's say there are 10 concurrent users. "Concurrent" means people trying to use at the same time—like, for example, you and I might use WhatsApp at the same time. Similarly, there can be thousands of users who are trying to access WhatsApp at the same point of time.

If every request is going to only one particular pod, then this pod will go down because it is getting too much load. So that's why what you usually do is you create multiple replicas. The number of replicas depends upon the number of users trying to access your applications and also the number of connections one particular pod can take.

If somebody asks, "What is the ideal pod size or what is the ideal pod count?" What will you say? It depends upon the number of concurrent users and number of requests one replica of your application can handle.

So if one replica of your application can handle 10 requests at one time and if you have 100 requests that are coming in, then you have to create 10 pods. So you have to take this decision as a DevOps engineer. As developers, you have to sit together and take this decision.

Now, if we don't deviate, let's say there are three pods. Now, for these three pods, the problem is that let's say one of these pods has gone down for some reason. There is some network issue. In the world of Kubernetes, in the world of containers, a pod going down or a container going down is very common.

But what is the advantage of Kubernetes? It's because of its auto-healing capability. So why do we move towards Kubernetes? Because Kubernetes has this auto-healing capability. Containers are ephemeral, so if the containers die, they do not come up. Similarly, if a pod goes down, it will not come up automatically unless you have the auto-healing behavior that is implemented by the deployment in Kubernetes or the replica set controller in Kubernetes.

Now let's say you have the auto-healing in place. So what happens as soon as this pod has gone down? What will this replica set say? "Don't worry, I am here. Let me create one more copy." This copy will be created even before the actual one is deleted or in parallel—it happens.

So you have this one back. But the problem is that when this one comes up—let's say previously the IP addresses were 172.16.3.4, 3.5, and 3.6—next time when it came up, the IP address will change. Previously, if it was 172.16.3.4, when it comes up this time, it might be 172.16.3.8.

So what happened is: okay, the application came up, but the IP address of the application has changed. Now we are talking about the scenario where there is no services concept in Kubernetes. So what will happen? Your application IP addresses you have to share with your test team, your other project team who is using these applications, or third-party applications or something.

What they usually do is they'll try to access this application. Let's say there are three teams who are trying to access this application—or three people who are trying to access this application. You said, for user number one, this is the IP address; user number two, this is the IP address; user number three, this is the IP address.

As a DevOps engineer, you thought, "I created a deployment which created a replica set, which created three replicas of pods, and there are three users. So if they try to use it in parallel, my applications are accessible." Because you created three replicas of the pods and for one person you said 172.16.3.4, for another 172.16.3.5, and for another 172.16.3.6.

You are in an assumption that everything is right. But now what has happened—even though you have the auto-healing capability of Kubernetes—because the IP address has changed, so this is pod one, pod two, and pod three, but the IP address is new: 172.16.3.8.

So this user one, or project one, let's say there are 10 people in project one who are trying to test this application. What they said is: "Your application is not reachable" or "Your application is not working." But as a DevOps engineer, what are you arguing? "No, my application is there. I can see my application. You are doing something wrong."

End of the day, you realized that after debugging, he is trying to send requests to 172.16.3.4, but the IP address of your application is 172.16.3.8. So neither he is wrong nor you are wrong. Because you have implemented auto-healing, and he said, "I have used the same IP address that you gave."

So this is the problem. And even if you look at the real world—okay, so the real world will never work like this. Let's say all of us use google.com on a day-to-day basis. Will Google ever tell you, "Try to access my application on an IP address called 100.64.2.7"? Or for another user, Google will say, "Okay, access me on 172.16.3.9."

Let’s say Google has 100 replicas now. Google will never tell you, "1 million users access on this IP, another million access on this IP." That doesn't work like that.

So what is the concept here? The concept is Google does load balancing.

And even I told you when I introduced you all to Kubernetes that there is a concept called load balancing in Kubernetes, and I’ll teach you later. So what you will tell this user/project team is, “Okay, do not access using these IP addresses.”

What you will do is—you created a deployment for this. You will tell them that on top of this, “I will create something called a Service.”

The shortcut for Service is `svc`. So I will create something called a Service, and what you do is, instead of accessing these specific things directly, try to access the Service.

Hello everyone, my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel. So today we are at Day 35 of our complete DevOps course. In this class, we will try to learn about Kubernetes Services. So, Service is a very critical component of Kubernetes.

So what is the concept here? The concept is Google does load balancing.

And even I told you when I introduced you all to Kubernetes that there is a concept called load balancing in Kubernetes, and I’ll teach you later. So what you will tell this user/project team is, “Okay, do not access using these IP addresses.”

What you will do is—you created a deployment for this. You will tell them that on top of this, “I will create something called a Service.”

The shortcut for Service is `svc`. So I will create something called a Service, and what you do is, instead of accessing these specific things directly, try to access the Service.

This Service will be created with the help of the selector. And that selector should be equal to the label of your pod. So that this Service will select all these pods, and whenever a request comes to this Service, it will do load balancing among these three pods.

Now, even if any pod goes down and comes back up with a new IP, what happens? This Service will automatically discover this pod, and it will start sending requests to the new one also.

So even though the application is not static, like its IP is not static, Service is able to discover the pods using the label and selector concept.

So this is the main reason why we use a Service.

**Types of Kubernetes Services**

Whenever you are creating a Kubernetes Service resource in the YAML manifest, what you can say is you can create this Service of three types:

1. **ClusterIP** (default type)
2. **NodePort**
3. **LoadBalancer**

There are other types as well like Headless Services, but we are not talking about those.

### ClusterIP

If you create a Service using a ClusterIP mode, then your application will still be only accessible **inside the Kubernetes cluster**. Nothing will change for you. Only if you create a Service with this ClusterIP mode, what happens is—you will get the two benefits we talked about:

* **Service Discovery**
* **Load Balancing**

### NodePort

If you create a Service of type NodePort, it will allow your application to be accessed **inside your organization**—from people who have access to your worker node IP addresses.

So, in very simple terms, whoever has access to your EC2 instance (worker node) IP addresses, they can access the application via the exposed port.

### LoadBalancer

LoadBalancer type Service will expose your application to the **external world**.

Let’s say you deploy this on an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster. When you create a Service of type LoadBalancer, Kubernetes (with help from the **Cloud Controller Manager**) will ask AWS to assign a public Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) IP address for this Service.

So, **anyone on the internet** can access your application through this ELB IP.

Note: The LoadBalancer type **only works on cloud platforms** like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. If you are working on `minikube` or a local setup, LoadBalancer service will not work by default.

For that, we will learn about **Ingress** in future classes.

So, to summarize:

* **ClusterIP** → Internal access only (within K8s cluster)
* **NodePort** → External access via node IPs & ports (within VPC/org)
* **LoadBalancer** → Public internet access (via cloud-managed load balancer)

Use case examples:

* **Amazon.com** → Would use a **LoadBalancer** Service
* **Internal tooling for DevOps team** → Use **ClusterIP**
* **Access from your VPC but not world-wide** → Use **NodePort**
