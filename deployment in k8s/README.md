**Kubernetes in Production: Transcript (Formatted Verbatim - Day 34)**

---

Hello everyone, my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel. So today is **Day 34** of our complete DevOps course. Congratulations — we already reached Day 34 of the 45-day DevOps journey. In this class, we'll be talking about **Kubernetes Deployment**.

From classes Day 30 to 33, we tried to understand in depth about the Kubernetes architecture — how it compares with Docker, and Kubernetes installations on-premise as well as cloud. Today, on Day 34, we will be learning about **Kubernetes Deployment**.

So what is Kubernetes Deployment? To understand that, everyone must have watched the previous video — Day 33. It's very important because we talked about **Kubernetes Pods**.

---

### Why Deployment If Pod Exists?

Let’s try to understand the difference here itself: if Kubernetes can do things with Pod — if you can deploy your application onto Kubernetes as a Pod — then **why do you require Deployment**?

The comparison we are going to look at is:

* Container vs
* Pod vs
* Deployment

This is an **interview question** as well. People might ask you: “What is the difference between a container, pod, and deployment?” You might feel it’s an entry-level question, but if you can't answer this question, the interviewer will understand you don’t have Kubernetes experience.

---

### Docker-style vs Kubernetes-style

From Day 23 to Day 30, we discussed how you create containers using platforms like Docker.

To run a Docker container, you usually provide specifications via CLI:

```bash
docker run -it  
# or 
docker run -d 
# then 
--name <name> 
-p <port> 
-v <volume> 
--network <network>
```

You're passing a bunch of options here. Now Kubernetes says: **Let me modify this process and bring an enterprise model to it.**

Instead of writing all of this on the command line, Kubernetes allows you to define it inside a **YAML manifest file**.

In this YAML manifest (e.g. `pod.yaml`), you define:

* Container image
* Port
* Volume
* Network

So a `pod.yaml` is basically a **running specification** of your Docker container. The only difference is — a Pod can run **single or multiple containers**.

Why multiple containers in one pod? Because maybe:

* Your app depends on another sidecar container
* Your container includes an API gateway or load balancer as a sidecar

So use cases like **service mesh** apply here. In this case, both containers can:

* Share the same **networking** (talk over `localhost`)
* Share the same **storage**

---

### What Is a Deployment?

Now, we already saw in Day 33 how to create a Pod and deploy NGINX. Then **why transition from Pod to Deployment**?

Because Pods:

* Cannot auto-heal
* Cannot auto-scale

Pod is only a wrapper with YAML for running containers. But it cannot do things like:

* Self-recovery
* Scaling under load

Those capabilities come with **Deployment**.

---

### What Happens in a Deployment?

When you create a **Deployment**, internally it creates:

1. A **ReplicaSet**
2. The ReplicaSet then creates one or more **Pods**

So, Kubernetes recommends:

> Do **not** create Pods directly — use Deployments.

Deployment is a resource. When you define it in YAML, you can say:

```yaml
replicas: 2
```

This means you want **2 Pods**.

If one Pod gets deleted by mistake or due to failure, the ReplicaSet (a **Kubernetes Controller**) ensures 2 Pods exist — **auto-healing**.

If the YAML file says 100 replicas and only 99 exist, ReplicaSet creates 1 more to match the desired state.

So with Deployment, you get:

* Auto-healing
* Zero-downtime deployments
* Easy scaling (change `replicas` in YAML)

---

### What Is a Kubernetes Controller?

A **Controller** maintains the actual state of the system to match the desired state (defined in YAML).

There are two types:

* Default Controllers (like ReplicaSet)
* Custom Controllers (like ArgoCD)

ReplicaSet is a default controller. It watches if the right number of Pods exist and creates/deletes them as needed.

---

### Interview Questions

**1. Difference between:**

* Container vs Pod vs Deployment

**2. Difference between:**

* Deployment vs ReplicaSet

ReplicaSet is the **actual Kubernetes controller** doing the work — creating Pods and healing them.

Deployment is the abstraction — a high-level wrapper that manages ReplicaSets and Pods.

---

### Hands-On Demo (Terminal)

Assume you already created a Kubernetes cluster (e.g. with **minikube** or **AWS + kops**).

Let’s start:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete deployment <name>  # clean state
kubectl get all                   # lists all resources in namespace
kubectl get all -A               # lists all across all namespaces
```

Now open `pod.yaml`, create a Pod (like last class):

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods -o wide         # shows Pod IP
```

To access it:

```bash
minikube ssh                     # login to the cluster
curl <pod-ip>                    # test app
```

Now, delete the Pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx
```

You’ll see app is **not reachable** anymore.

So what is the benefit of Kubernetes if Pods die like in Docker?

The answer: You **must use Deployment** instead of raw Pod.

---

### Creating a Deployment

Don’t memorize the YAML syntax. Instead:

* Refer to Kubernetes official examples
* Modify image, ports, labels, etc.

```yaml
replicas: 1
```

Create the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get replicasets (or: kubectl get rs)
kubectl get pods
```

You’ll see:

* Deployment created the ReplicaSet
* ReplicaSet created the Pod

Deployment is just a wrapper — **it won’t do anything by itself**. The **ReplicaSet (controller)** takes care of the real work.

---

### Auto-Healing in Action

Open 2 terminals:

```bash
Terminal 1:
kubectl get pods -w        # watches live changes

Terminal 2:
kubectl delete pod <name>
```

You’ll notice:

* `Terminating` pod is followed by new pod being `Running`
* Both happen **in parallel** (zero downtime)

Even if someone deletes a pod, the ReplicaSet maintains **desired replica count**.

---

### Scaling a Deployment

Edit deployment:

```bash
vim deployment.yaml       # change replicas: 1 → 3
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Observe:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You’ll see 3 Pods.

Now delete 1 pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <name>
```

ReplicaSet recreates it instantly to keep 3 running.

---

### Assignment

1. Create a deployment from the example
2. Replace image (use your own app)
3. Delete pod and observe
4. Scale up replica count and observe new pods

You can find more examples:

* Search GitHub for: `kubernetes deployment examples`
* Use: [kubernetes/examples](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples)

Look for `guestbook` or `all-in-one.yaml` files. You'll see how full deployments are structured.

---

### Final Notes

In **real-world Kubernetes**, you **never create a Pod directly**.

You always:

* Create **Deployments**
* Let them manage **ReplicaSets** and **Pods**

This gives you:

* Zero-downtime deployments
* Auto-healing
* Scalability

You’ll learn about **Services**, **Ingress**, and more in upcoming classes. But for now, master Pods → ReplicaSets → Deployments.

**Kubernetes in Production: Transcript – Day 34 (Q\&A with Grammar Corrections)**

---

**Q: Who is the speaker and what is the topic of the day?**
**A:** Hello everyone, my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel. Today is **Day 34** of our complete DevOps course. Congratulations — we’ve already reached Day 34 of the 45-day DevOps journey. In this class, we’ll be talking about **Kubernetes Deployment**.

---

**Q: What have we covered in the previous classes (Day 30–33)?**
**A:** From Day 30 to Day 33, we learned about Kubernetes architecture, comparisons with Docker, and Kubernetes installations on-premise and in the cloud.

---

**Q: What is Kubernetes Deployment and why do we need it if Pods exist?**
**A:** Kubernetes can deploy apps using Pods, but Deployment offers advanced capabilities. The main comparison is:

* **Container vs Pod vs Deployment**

This is also a common interview question. Not knowing this might indicate a lack of Kubernetes experience.

---

**Q: How does a container run in Docker vs Kubernetes?**
**A:** In Docker, you use CLI:

```bash
docker run -it OR docker run -d --name <name> -p <port> -v <volume> --network <network>
```

In Kubernetes, instead of CLI flags, you write a YAML manifest to define:

* Image
* Port
* Volume
* Network

---

**Q: What is the structure of a Pod in Kubernetes?**
**A:** A Pod is a YAML specification to run containers. You can have:

* Single container per Pod
* Multiple containers (e.g., main app + sidecar)

They share the same networking (can use localhost) and storage.

---

**Q: Why use Deployment instead of just a Pod?**
**A:** Pods cannot auto-heal or auto-scale. A Deployment provides:

* Auto healing
* Auto scaling

Deployments are an abstraction that internally create:

* A ReplicaSet (controller)
* Which then creates Pods

---

**Q: How does ReplicaSet work with Deployment?**
**A:** When you define `replicas: 2`, Deployment passes this to ReplicaSet. ReplicaSet ensures the desired number of Pods exist. If a Pod is deleted or fails, it recreates it automatically.

---

**Q: What is a Kubernetes Controller?**
**A:** A controller maintains the actual cluster state to match the desired YAML state. Types:

* Default (e.g., ReplicaSet)
* Custom (e.g., ArgoCD)

Controllers implement logic to reconcile actual and desired state.

---

**Q: What are the main interview questions based on this topic?**
**A:**

1. What’s the difference between Container, Pod, and Deployment?
2. What’s the difference between Deployment and ReplicaSet?

---

**Q: What commands are used in the hands-on demo?**
**A:**

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete deployment <name>
kubectl get all
kubectl get all -A
```

Then create a Pod:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Access the Pod:

```bash
minikube ssh
curl <pod-ip>
```

Delete the Pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx
```

Now the app is unreachable — proving Pods don't auto-heal.

---

**Q: How do you create a Deployment?**
**A:** Modify an official YAML example. Set your own image, ports, labels, etc.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get rs (replica sets)
kubectl get pods
```

---

**Q: What happens when a Pod is deleted in a Deployment?**
**A:** ReplicaSet detects the missing Pod and instantly recreates it.

```bash
Terminal 1: kubectl get pods -w
Terminal 2: kubectl delete pod <name>
```

You'll see Terminating + Running in parallel — zero downtime.

---

**Q: How to scale a Deployment?**
**A:** Edit the deployment YAML:

```yaml
replicas: 3
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Check:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Deleting one Pod will still maintain 3 replicas.

---

**Q: What’s the assignment for the day?**
**A:**

1. Create a deployment from the example.
2. Replace image with your app.
3. Delete a Pod and observe auto-healing.
4. Scale replicas and observe behavior.

Explore examples:

* Search GitHub for: `kubernetes deployment examples`
* Example: `guestbook`, `all-in-one.yaml`

---

**Q: Final notes?**
**A:** In production, never create Pods directly. Use Deployments. They give you:

* Zero-downtime
* Auto-healing
* Scalability

Upcoming classes will cover **Services** and **Ingress**.

---

**Q: Who is the speaker and what is the topic of the day?**
**A:** Hello everyone, my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel. So today is day 34 of our complete DevOps course. Congratulations — we already reached day 34 of 45 days DevOps journey. And, you know, in this class, we'll be talking about Kubernetes Deployment.

---

**Q: What have we covered in the previous classes (Day 30–33)?**
**A:** From classes day 30 to 33, we tried to understand in-depth about the Kubernetes architecture, how is it compared with Docker, Kubernetes installations on-premise as well as cloud. And today on day 34, we will be learning about the Kubernetes Deployment.

---

**Q: Why do we need Kubernetes Deployment if we already have Pods?**
**A:** To understand that, everyone must have watched the previous video — that is day 33. It is very important because we talked about Kubernetes Pods. Let's try to understand the difference here itself. If Kubernetes can do things with Pods — like if you can deploy your application onto Kubernetes as a Pod — then why do you require Deployment?

So, what is the comparison that we are going to look at? The difference between a Container, a Pod, and a Deployment. This is your interview question as well. People will ask you in an interview: What is the difference between a Container, Pod, and Deployment?

You might feel this is a very entry-level question but if you can't answer this question then, you know, that itself your interviewer will understand that you don't have experience on Kubernetes.

---

**Q: What is a container and how do we normally run it in Docker?**
**A:** Containers — like we have watched from day 23 to day 30 — you can create containers using any container platform like Docker. To run this container, you usually provide specifications on the command line:

```bash
docker run -it  # or -d for detached mode
```

Followed by image name, then:

```bash
-p <port>
-v <volume>
--network <network>
```

---

**Q: What does Kubernetes do differently?**
**A:** Kubernetes says: Instead of writing all these things in the command line, create a YAML manifest. Inside it, define everything:

* container image
* port to run on
* volumes
* network settings

A pod.yaml is a running specification for your container — nothing more than that.

---

**Q: Can a Pod have multiple containers? Why?**
**A:** Yes. A Pod can be single or multiple containers. Why multiple? If your app depends on another app (like a sidecar), or uses API gateway rules or service mesh, you can put both in the same Pod. This way they can:

* share localhost
* share volume

---

**Q: So, if Pods can run containers, why use Deployments?**
**A:** Great question. Pods can deploy your app. But here’s the problem: Pods do **not** support auto-healing or auto-scaling.

Two major features Kubernetes offers:

1. Auto-healing
2. Auto-scaling

These are not supported by just using Pods. That’s why you use **Deployment**.

---

**Q: What happens when we use a Deployment instead of a Pod?**
**A:** When you create a Deployment, it creates an intermediate resource called **ReplicaSet**. The ReplicaSet creates **Pods** for you.

Flow:

```
Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pods
```

---

**Q: What is the role of ReplicaSet in Deployment?**
**A:** Inside Deployment, you say `replicas: 2` (for example). ReplicaSet ensures 2 Pods always exist.
If one Pod is deleted by mistake, ReplicaSet brings it back.

---

**Q: What is a Kubernetes Controller?**
**A:** A controller ensures the actual state matches the desired state defined in the YAML. Examples:

* ReplicaSet (default controller)
* ArgoCD, Admission Controllers (custom)

---

**Q: How to verify this behavior practically?**
**A:** Use the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete deployment <name>
kubectl get all
kubectl get all -A
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Access the Pod:

```bash
minikube ssh
curl <pod-ip>
```

Delete the Pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx
```

Now the app is unreachable — proving Pods don't auto-heal.

---

**Q: How to create a Deployment?**
**A:** Use this YAML structure from Kubernetes documentation. Modify:

* image
* replicas
* labels

Then apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
```

---

**Q: What happens during scaling?**
**A:** Modify deployment.yaml:

```yaml
replicas: 3
```

Then apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Even if you delete one Pod, ReplicaSet ensures 3 always exist.

---

**Q: What happens when you delete a Pod from a Deployment?**
**A:** Demo this live with two terminals:

```bash
Terminal 1:
kubectl get pods -w

Terminal 2:
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

You’ll see:

* Terminating old Pod
* Running new Pod
  Simultaneously — that’s **zero downtime**.

---

**Q: Final Words & Assignment**
**A:** Never create Pods directly in production. Always use Deployments.

**Assignment:**

1. Create a Deployment
2. Replace image
3. Delete a Pod — observe auto-healing
4. Increase replicas — see scaling
