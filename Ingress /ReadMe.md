Great! Since you've already added the **Kubernetes Services** demo in a clean format in your document, now let’s prepare a **step-by-step formatted extension** for **Day 38: Kubernetes Ingress** based on the full transcript you shared.

I’ll now update your document to include the **Day 38: Kubernetes Ingress** section directly below your Day 37 content. It will be structured like this:

## 📌 Day 38: Kubernetes Ingress — Complete Theory & Practical

### 🎯 Why Is Ingress Needed?

Before Kubernetes 1.1 (pre-2015), Ingress didn’t exist. Users relied solely on Kubernetes **Services** to expose their apps. However, users migrating from traditional VM-based setups identified **two major problems** with relying only on `Service`:

#### ⚠️ Problem 1: Missing Enterprise Load Balancer Features

Kubernetes `Service` (even of type `LoadBalancer`) only supports **simple round-robin** load balancing. It lacks:

* Path-based routing
* Host/domain-based routing
* Sticky sessions
* TLS termination (HTTPS support)
* IP whitelisting/blacklisting
* Ratio-based load balancing (3:7, etc.)
* Advanced security (WAF, TLS passthrough, etc.)

#### ⚠️ Problem 2: Cost of Load Balancer Per Service

Each Kubernetes service of type `LoadBalancer` creates **a new static public IP**, for which cloud providers **charge money**. In a microservices setup with 1000+ services, this is **very costly**.

---

### ✅ How Ingress Solves These

* Kubernetes introduced **Ingress Resource** to describe rules (paths/domains) for routing traffic.
* But Ingress requires a **Ingress Controller**, like:

  * **nginx**
  * **HAProxy**
  * **F5**
  * **Ambassador**
  * **Traefik**

> Kubernetes itself doesn’t do the routing logic. Ingress Controllers handle that, based on the Ingress resources you define.

### 🧱 Ingress Architecture Overview

```
User Request
   ↓
Ingress Controller (e.g., nginx)
   ↓
Ingress Resource (routes requests)
   ↓
Target Kubernetes Service
   ↓
Pods
```

* You define **Ingress Resources** (YAMLs with host/path rules)
* Your cluster must have an **Ingress Controller** installed
* The controller **watches Ingress resources** and routes traffic accordingly

## 🔧 Ingress Setup Demo on Minikube

---

### 1. ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure your app and service (NodePort) from Day 37 are already running.

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```

Confirm NodePort is working:

```bash
minikube ip
curl http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:<NODE_PORT>/demo
```

---

### 2. 📄 Create an Ingress Resource

Create `ingress.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-example
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /bar
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: python-django-app-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
kubectl get ingress
```

Note: Initially, the ADDRESS field will be empty.

---

### 3. 📦 Install Ingress Controller (on Minikube)

Use this command to install the **nginx ingress controller** addon:

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx <nginx-controller-pod>
```

You’ll see logs like:

```
Successfully validated configuration for Ingress "default/ingress-example"
```

Also, check `kubectl get ingress` — the `ADDRESS` will now be populated.

---

### 4. 🧪 Mock Domain for Local Testing

You need to map `foo.bar.com` to the Minikube IP:

Edit `/etc/hosts` (as root/admin):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add this line:

```
<MINIKUBE_IP> foo.bar.com
```

---

### 5. 🌐 Test Ingress Routing

Now access:

```bash
curl http://foo.bar.com/bar
```

You’ll see the same DevOps learning message as in Day 37.

---

### 📌 Advanced Ingress Features (Explore Later)

You can extend this by adding:

* **TLS support** for `https://`
* **Multiple paths/domains** in a single Ingress
* **Custom annotations** (rate limiting, rewrites, CORS, etc.)

For example, TLS-based Ingress:

```yaml
tls:
  - hosts:
      - foo.bar.com
    secretName: tls-secret
```

## ✅ Summary

| Feature               | Service (LoadBalancer) | Ingress |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| Round-robin           | ✅                      | ✅       |
| Path-based routing    | ❌                      | ✅       |
| Domain-based routing  | ❌                      | ✅       |
| TLS/HTTPS termination | ❌                      | ✅       |
| Cloud cost            | High (per IP)          | Low     |
| Custom load rules     | ❌                      | ✅       |

If you're ready, I can **update the existing document** to append this new **"Day 38: Kubernetes Ingress"** section right after the current content.

Shall I proceed to add this to your document? Or would you like a **PDF** version instead?
